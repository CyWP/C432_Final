# Convolutional Experimentation on Motor Imagery Data

The following notebook includes custom implementations of neural networks meant to decode motor imagery using the [BNCI2014001](http://moabb.neurotechx.com/docs/generated/moabb.datasets.BNCI2014_001.html#moabb.datasets.BNCI2014_001) dataset, with the help of the [speechbrain-MOABB](https://github.com/speechbrain/benchmarks/tree/main/benchmarks/MOABB) library. \
This project was completed as a final project for COMP432: Machine Learning at Concordia University, Montreal, Qc.
