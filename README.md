# Convolutional Experimentation on Motor Imagery Data

The following notebook includes custom implementations of neural networks meant to decode motor imagery using the BNCI2014001 dataset, with the help of the speechbrain-MOABB library. \
This prject was completed as a final project for COMP432: Machine Learning at Concordia University, Montreal, Qc.
